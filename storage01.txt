in azure subscription

free tier = 30days = 200$
pas as you go


	tenant
subscription-1,subscription-2.subscription-3

resourcegroup= collection of resources

resource- vm,storage,database,etc


resource group comes under region wise (chosse the region while creating resource group)
in this resourcegroup  we create a resource in defult region or different region
in a single resource goup - can create diffrenet resource in diff region
vm1 - ind
vm2 - east asia


intranet = local n/w connect using private ip
internet = access over the global using public-ip

storage in azure 

# https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction

The name must be unique across all existing storage account names in Azure. 
It must be 3 to 24 characters long, and can contain only lowercase letters and numbers

# https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy

Locally redundant storage (LRS) replicates the data within your storage accounts to one or more Azure availability zones located in the primary region of your choice

Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) copies your data synchronously across three or more Azure availability zones in the primary region. For applications requiring high availability, Microsoft recommends using ZRS in the primary region, and also replicating to a secondary region.

Geo-redundant storage (GRS) copies your data synchronously within one or more Azure availability zones in the primary region using LRS. It then copies your data asynchronously to the secondary region. 
Within the secondary region, your data is copied synchronously using LRS.

Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS) copies your data synchronously across three or more Azure availability zones in the primary region using ZRS. 
It then copies your data asynchronously to the secondary region. 
Within the secondary region, your data is copied synchronously using LRS.

Storage service			Endpoint
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blob Storage			https://<storage-account>.blob.core.windows.net
Static website (Blob Storage)	https://<storage-account>.web.core.windows.net
Data Lake Storage		https://<storage-account>.dfs.core.windows.net
Azure Files			https://<storage-account>.file.core.windows.net
Queue Storage			https://<storage-account>.queue.core.windows.net
Table Storage			https://<storage-account>.table.core.windows.net
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

create storage account choose with type of storege required blob,file,table,queue
then create a container inside the container can store any objetcs

if the storage create using blob then only we can create Data lake stoarge
in Hierarchical Namespace  need to Enable hierarchical namespace to create data lake storage

---
Hierarchical namespace, complemented by Data Lake Storage Gen2 endpoint, enables file and directory semantics, accelerates big data analytics workloads, and enables access control lists (ACLs)Learn more

Enable hierarchical namespace *

before enable versioning

file1 -
	123
	abc
	a1b2c3
	xyz
	

after enable versioning (version are logical) whien used the veriosnid to vire the file then can see the content what we stored in that version

file1 -
	123  	1
	abc     2
	a1b2c3	3
	xyz
